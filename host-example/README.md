# host-example

This is simple Rainway host application with a command-line interface, powered by the [host-example-core](../host-example-core) example. See [../README.md](../README.md) for more information.

## Usage

* Build this project.
* Get a Rainway API key [from the Hub](https://hub.rainway.com/keys).
* Run the executable with your API key as a command line argument: `.\host-example.exe pk_live_xxxxx`
* The application displays a Peer ID when it's connected to Rainway. You can use this in the [Web Demo](https://webdemo.rainway.com/) on another device to connect remotely and initiate an interactive stream.
